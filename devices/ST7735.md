![ST7735 LCD module](module.jpg)

This is an very common LCD controller for 128x160 LCDs. These are available cheaply from via various suppliers online.

Support is included in the [[ST7735.js]] module, using the [[Graphics]] library.

Just wire up as follows:

| LCD pin    | Pin type | Example pin on Espruino Board |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------|
|  VCC       | 5V       | Bat    or     Bat    or  ...  |
|  GND       | GND      | GND           GND             |
|  CS        | Any      | B8            B10             |
|  RES       | Any      | B7            B11             |
|  RS/DC     | Any      | B6            A3              |
|  SDA(MOSI) | SPI MOSI | B5            A7              |
|  SCL       | SPI SCK  | B3            A5              |

```

SPI1.setup({sck:B3, mosi:B5, baud: 1000000});
var g = require("ST7735").connect(SPI1, B6, B8, B7, function() {
  g.clear();
  g.drawString("Hello",0,0);
  g.setFontVector(20);
  g.setColor(0,0.5,1);
  g.drawString("Espruino",0,10);
});
```

Note:

* The display takes around TODOms to initialise after calling 'connect'. There's an optional callback that is called after this time (shown in the example). Sending data to it before initialisation may cause it not to initialise correctly.
* This module doesn't use a double-buffer as there isn't enough RAM. Pixels are written to the display as they are drawn, and the driver is written in JavaScript so it is relatively slow.
